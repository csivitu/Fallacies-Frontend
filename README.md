Fallacies is an online cryptic hunt where players hunt for clues to deliver an answer. The cryptic quiz is based on the theme of conspiracy theories . The questions are  framed such that the participants will not only require their knowledge but also reasoning and resourcefulness on the internet.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is a simple representation of the structure of the frontend of the fallacies. This code in this repo doesnt not support api calls to the Fallacies-Backend. There is no form validation and you can wander through the pages just by clicking buttons without filling any forms.

The repo is hosted to the Login page. The LOG IN button leads to the Homepage and the Sign Up button at bottom leads to the Sign Up page.

The SIGN UP button on the Sign up page leads to the Login page

The Homepage had two buttons PLAY and LEADERBOARD. The PLAY button leads to the gamepage and the Leaderboard button to the leaderboard page. The LOG OUT button at bottom left takes back to the Login page

The Gamepage contains the instructions to process and the account names along with a field to submit the answer. Gamepage has a LEADERBOARD button at bottom right which takes to the Leaderboard page. The LOG OUT button at bottom left takes back to the Login page

The Leaderboard displays the leaderboard and also has a SUBMISSIONS button to go back to the gamepage.
